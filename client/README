Client API for Open Audio Server
================================

Installation and Set-Up
-----------------------

1.  Checkout the source code.
2.  From inside the checked out repository, change to the build directory,
    with `cd build`
3.  If you want to configure options yourself, type `ccmake ..`
    You can also enable compiling the examples at this point.
    Otherwise, if you want to go with default options you can just type `cmake ..`
    Default options will install the library and include files to `/usr/local/`
4.  Then, you can compile with `make` and install the library with `make install`
5.  To generate documentation with Doxygen, use `make docs`.


Examples
--------

There is a directory with source code containing basic examples that demonstrate
the server's functionality. They are not compiled by default. To enable
compilation of the examples, use `ccmake ..` in the `build` directory, and 
enable the relevant options. After the new makefiles are generated, perform
another `make`, and the examples should be compiled into the `build/examples/`
directory.
