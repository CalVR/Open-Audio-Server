Installation and Set-Up
-----------------------

1.  Checkout the source code.
2.  From inside the checked out repository, change to the build directory,
    with `cd build`
3.  If you want to configure options yourself, type `ccmake ..`

    Otherwise, if you want to go with default options you can just type `cmake ..`
    Default options will install the library and include files to `/usr/local/`
4.  Then, you can compile with `make` and install the library with `make install`
5.  To generate documentation with Doxygen, use `make docs`
