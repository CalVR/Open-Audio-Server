Open Audio Server
=================

This project is separated into two components: server and client.


The server portion contains the source code and build system necessary to 
compile and run the Open Audio Server (OAS). See the README in the server 
directory for more information.


The client component contains a client API to help communicate with the server.
There is also sample code that can be compiled and played to demonstrate the 
server's functionality. See the README in the client directory for more 
information.
