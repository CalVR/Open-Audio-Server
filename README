Open Audio Server
=================

This project is separated into two components: server and client.

The server portion contains the source code and build system necessary to 
compile and run the Open Audio Server (OAS). The client component contains a
client API to help communicate with the server. There are also client examples 
that can be compiled and played to demonstrate the server's functionality.
